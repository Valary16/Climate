    <h2>World Environment Day</h2>
    It is celebrated on 5 June of each year. It is a global day for creating awareness about the protection of the environment.
     UN emphasizes on environmental conservation and natural resource management.
        <h2>World Forest Day</h2>
        The International Day of Forests is celebrated on the 21st of March every year. 
        FTFA marked the day with various tree planting events across the country, as well as an official seminar hosted by the Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF). 
        DAFF committed 2000 trees to be donated to beneficiaries identified by FTFA, in honour of the day. This included 1000 trees to schools and farmers in Evaton, 
        which were distributed from the site of FTFAâ€™s first food forest. 
        <h2>Marine Life</h2>
        Marine life, sea life, or ocean life is the plants, animals and other organisms that live in the salt water of seas or oceans,
         or the brackish water of coastal estuaries. At a fundamental level, marine life affects the nature of the planet. 
         Marine organisms, mostly microorganisms, produce oxygen and sequester carbon.
